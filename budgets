01:38 < BrainDamage> we used an A/C pump as roughening, then a molecular sieve in a cold trap to increase
01:38 < Laurenceb_> youre gunna have to go pretty fast
01:38 < Laurenceb_> but if you can its about the simplest fusion scheme ever
01:38 < sync> wat BrainDamage
01:39 < Laurenceb_> sync: thats like a standard vacuum technique
01:39 < BrainDamage> water vapour is the dominant gas at the pressure the roughening pump was operating
01:39 < Laurenceb_> yeah
01:40 < sync> Laurenceb_: not really
01:41 < Laurenceb_> well its a little junkyard grade
01:41 < sync> my standard vacuum technique is scroll pump on a turbo, then ion getters and Ti sublimators to get the noble gas rate up
01:41 < BrainDamage> again, i have to remind you about the budget
01:41 < Laurenceb_> sync: your standard technique is to blow the budget
