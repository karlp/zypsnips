21:53 <BrainDamage> when the shunt was too hot, the motor was stalling for too long so stop it?
21:53 <BrainDamage> alternate idea: measure the noise of the gears grinding
21:54 <kakium69> I didn't thought that :o
21:54 <BrainDamage> when the noise is too loud, stop it

21:54 <kakium69> it goes silent when it arrives to top
21:54 <kakium69> maybe 8000hz burr from motor pwm
21:56 <BrainDamage> then the supply was insufficient
21:56 <kakium69> indeed
21:56 <BrainDamage> everything should be on the verge of self destruction with firmware being the only mean of safety
21:57 <kakium69> interesting perspective
