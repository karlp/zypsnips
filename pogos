05:00 < dongs> the ones you want are called P75-LM2
05:05 < dongs> dude my typical bed of nails uses like 20-50 of these
05:05 < dongs> so yeah...?
05:06 < dongs> i mean if you are making one fucking connector jsut buy and shut up
05:06 < dongs> and use them later in other shit'
05:06 < dongs> sometimes i add several gnd points per board

23:19 < lurchi_> karlp: I have some pogos here which are about 70% the size of the Hirschmann MPS
23:20 < lurchi_> fine enough for contacting 0.4mm pitch if you can arrange them in zigzag fashion
23:21 < lurchi_> price each is about 0.05â‚¬ if you buy 50
23:32 < lurchi_> just search for P50-B1 (sharp tip), P50-J1 (round tip)

23:36:10        jadew | I like the LM head
23:36:18        jadew | best contact I think
23:36:46        jadew | P75-LM2 is the best option IMO

00:25:37       Cracki | back to pogo pins
00:25:44       Cracki | I got P50 and P75
00:26:05       Cracki | P50 because 0.6x mm would kinda fit inside pin strip headers
00:26:16       Cracki | P75 because it fits pretty much exactly into TH pads
00:26:55       Cracki | 0.65mm squares are ~0.92 mm diagonally
00:27:19       Cracki | so the typical TH pads I see on random boards around me are slightly larger than
                      | 0.92mm diameter
