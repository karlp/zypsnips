(VDD/VSS pin swap)

11:28 < jpa-> could've just lifted the pins, IIRC stm32 has internal connection
between the pins even though you are supposed to connect them all
11:29 < ReadError> o
11:29 < ReadError> i couldnt find anything in the datasheet
11:29 < ReadError> that was my 1st choice ;/
11:29 < jpa-> it is not specced
11:31 < ReadError> boop test seems to confirm this
11:31 < ReadError> should have woken up more before i did this..
11:32 < GargantuaSauce> probably safer than having them so close together that
the board flexing from plugging in a connector or whatever could short them
(added for good measure)
12:19 < dongs> how the fuck can you even swap gnd/vss
12:19 < dongs> does eagle not have some way to tell you "IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO FUCK UP.  WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CLIPPY ASSISTANCE? Y/N"
