soldering irons
15:18:06               * | PaulFertser still considers buying TS-100 just to have an easily portable
                         | temperature-controlled thing. And the reviews seem to be largerly positive. Yes/no?
15:37:12         kakimir | PaulFertser: there is opensource pcb for ts100 now
15:37:20         kakimir | that uses usb-c
15:38:12         kakimir | and way more power than ts80 or whatever the usb-c thing is by miniware
15:38:34     BrainDamage | PaulFertser: I hae a ts-100 and it's very good
15:38:41         bitmask | yay, paraloid b72 arrives today, now i'll have a better conductive paint
15:38:42     BrainDamage | and I use the open source firmware
15:39:01         kakimir | ts100 is a ok
15:39:31     PaulFertser | kakimir: but I do not need usb-c. It's good to know though.
15:40:01     PaulFertser | BrainDamage: thank you for confirmation! How good is it compared to weller or hakko or
                         | probably other professional equipment you had a chance to work with?
15:40:22         kakimir | I use it with 19V laptop supply and it's okay-ish. 12V in emergency only
15:40:34         kakimir | 24V for optimum results 
15:41:35     BrainDamage | I use a 24V laptop supply, heats up fast, the thermal transfer isn't as good as a "pro"
                         | soldering iron, but for the price it's good quality, slightly annoying that you want to
                         | disable is the accelerometer to switch side the display
15:41:46     BrainDamage | unless you're ambidextrous, it's not a problem
15:42:06     BrainDamage | head shielding is ok
15:42:17     BrainDamage | no tip oxidation so far also
15:42:34     BrainDamage | the main annoyance is the nonstandard tips that are slightly expensive
15:42:50         kakimir | PaulFertser: BC2 is the only type of iron tip you want to buy TS100 with
15:43:28         kakimir | don't be fooled by sellers that throw some sharp tip in instead of BC2
15:43:42     BrainDamage | I use a BC2 too
15:43:59     PaulFertser | kakimir: TS-I is standard for "Sapphire Version", why is it bad?
15:44:21     BrainDamage | less surface for thermal transfer
15:44:46     PaulFertser | I've seen JBC pumping insane amount of power through a tiny tip.
15:45:43         kakimir | ts100 is not JBC
15:46:00         kakimir | you don't see such thermal transfer rates with TS100
15:46:07     PaulFertser | I wonder why accelerometer needs to be disabled is it not measuring negative
                         | "acceleration"?
15:47:08     PaulFertser | kakimir: if they both can deliver power to the tip it shouldn't matter what type of tip it
                         | is
15:47:32         kakimir | it still does and arent JCB:s like 100W power anyway?
15:49:25     PaulFertser | kakimir: yes, but if I'm ok with max power that ts100 is capable of, why is it any worse at
                         | delivering it via a smaller tip?
15:49:44         kakimir | idk but it is
15:50:36         kakimir | difference between bc2 and sharp tip soldering performance is more than marginal
15:51:21         kakimir | you can buy bc2 separatelly though and I recommend you to have one
15:51:29         kakimir | it's 12euros or so
15:51:53         kakimir | it's one of the more expensive tips
15:53:01         kakimir | what I have noticed with sharp tip is that 2mm of the tip get solder stuck to it and
                         | further down the tip solder is liquid
15:53:29         kakimir | idk if the idea is to crank it up to 450C or something
15:53:48     PaulFertser | What was the set temperature?
15:54:01         kakimir | something around 300
15:56:08     PaulFertser | That's probably marginal even for a Pb solder.
15:56:39         kakimir | what I think about sellers combining sharp tip with the iron is that they get sharp ones
                         | cheaper and then sell the default BC2 for more moneys
15:57:11     PaulFertser | Good discount for the tips currently: https://www.banggood.com/MINI-Original-Replacement-So
                         | lder-Tip-For-TS100-Digital-LCD-Soldering-Iron-p-984215.html
15:57:30     PaulFertser | Default is TS-B2, not BC2?
15:59:19     PaulFertser | https://www.banggood.com/MINI-TS100-Digital-OLED-Programmable-Interface-DC-5525-Soldering-I
                         | ron-Station-Built-in-STM32-Chip-p-984214.html seems to have TS-B2
15:59:21         kakimir | B2 could be useful with small shit
15:59:57     PaulFertser | TS-I is probably even more so with small shit and probably cranking up the temperature a   
                         | bit is not a problem.
16:00:59         kakimir | I have bought total of.. 5pcs ts100s for myself, for jubb and for friends
16:01:06     PaulFertser | Makes sense to get the iron with TS-I and buy TS-BC2 separately while that sale lasts?
16:01:17         kakimir | none of them have yet included B2
16:01:26         kakimir | PaulFertser: ye
16:01:36     PaulFertser | jubb? As a portable device or as a table station replacement?
16:01:48         kakimir | as cheap table station
16:03:22     PaulFertser | BrainDamage: the guy on video says hakko long tips are also fitting and working nicely, and
                         | with an additional handle the length is not an issue.
16:03:25         bitmask | not sure why im spending so much time on this cheap psu but I do like how it looks:    
                         | https://i.imgur.com/qqlQbF3.png
16:03:28     PaulFertser | kakimir: for serious everyday work?
16:03:42         kakimir | ye small shit work
16:04:22         kakimir | I mainly used reflow station and headpad though
16:04:46         kakimir | bitmask: are you making your own?
16:04:54         bitmask | nah not this time
16:04:58     PaulFertser | kakimir: didn't all the pros complain like "I want my Weller" or "gimme that metcal"?
16:04:59         kakimir | you know chinaman has made all this for you already?
16:05:16         kakimir | PaulFertser: I was the only pro
16:05:27     BrainDamage | PaulFertser: if you have a lipo charger, absolutely get the battery pack adapter
16:05:29         bitmask | left side is a b3606 cc/cv, 5v will be a generic buck, 12v is the actual supply and the
                         | right side will be a cv adjustable buck
16:05:34     PaulFertser | kakimir: I mean soldering pros, not engineers.
16:05:40         kakimir | yes
16:06:47         kakimir | I was the soldering pro
16:07:00     PaulFertser | BrainDamage: all my lipo chargers are not of that kind to be useful, and I have only a tiny
                         | 1S powered microheli so I do not really need anything like imaxb6 and 7s lipo assemblies :)
16:07:27     PaulFertser | Thank you for the advices kakimir, BrainDamage , much appreciated.
16:19:48      englishman | PaulFertser: i got a ts100 and wired it to use with a 6S lipo for ultimate portability
16:19:52      englishman | it has come in quite handy



bench meters:
08:02 <jpa-> meh, i must say that the owon XDM2041 is pretty crappy
08:02 <jpa-> noisy measurements, slow autorange
08:03 <jpa-> i guess i got what i paid for :)
08:29 <Steffanx> Return it to dutchland, jpa-
08:31 <jpa-> meh, not worth my time trying to get it returned - and it'll do what i need it to do


Power supplies:
Most people with Korad 300x series are happy with them.


Oscilloscopes:

qyx | Owon SDS6062E: all rotary encoders are barely functional
englishman | lol my owon encoders have sucked since day 1
05:35 <jpa-> Steffanx: the scope i got was rigol DS1054Z; it's been mostly ok, just some small annoyances with the menus & the multifunction encoder knob is a bit small for my shaky fingers
06:43 <emeb_mac> very happy with my Siglent sds1104x-e. 4chl 100MHz (1GSPS) with i2c/spi/serial decoding for ~$400
06:44 <emeb_mac> buddy of mine just got a bricked Hantek and was able to restore it by hacking into the Linux serial port and doing some fiddling around with the filesystem. He says it's very poorly coded & the scope locks up frequently.
06:45 <R2COM> my rigol DS4024 just works

22:17:27        invzim | I got the mso5074, would not buy again
22:17:32           zyp | oh?
22:17:43        invzim | the ui is really sluggish
22:18:09        invzim | like second+ resonse time
22:18:15           zyp | I've been eyeing those, but I can't really justify a new scope
22:18:49        invzim | and for some reason I can't do pulse trigger on channel 1&3 consistently


## oscilloscope probes:
### Current probes
zyp has some Hantek cc-65.  works good, but 9V battery doesn't turn off by itself, and runs out :|
