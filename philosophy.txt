01:04 < kakimir> did you cry after trying to make indie game?
01:04 < upgrdman> no
01:04 < kakimir> I think I did once..
01:04 < upgrdman> i cried after i realized my passion (3d shitz... so "art" in general) wouldn't pay 
                  for shit unless i was a lucky 1%. so i said fuck it and start to fuck with 
                  software and electronics


04:26 < dongs> what hte shit, i cut myself and didnt notice
04:26 < dongs> bleeding fuckign everywhere


04:59 < dongs> get high as fuck
05:00 < dongs> then stare at pink leds
05:00 < dongs> ^ story of my daily life


(On the atom editor)
04:13 < R2COM> atom sucks balls
04:13 < R2COM> it cant do vertical block select
04:14 < jadew> that's a bummer
04:14 < R2COM> its like a car without engine


(On artoocommie)
05:29 < dongs> nice stm32-related discussion there bros
05:29 < dongs> gave up scrolling up to find something useful

02:56 < R2COM> upgrdman but i do a lot of times wear adidas tracksuite
02:57 < R2COM> pants at least
02:57 < upgrdman> like italian mob boss?
02:57 < R2COM> because its convenient
02:57 < R2COM> long time ago i was wearing it a lot because if you suddenly get into some fight on street, its less of a problem if its teared that if it was expensive jeans



On MISRA-C:
04:13 < upgrdman> anyone know if theres an eclipse or visual studio plugin for checking MISRA C compliance?
04:23 < dongs> not free, no
04:23 < upgrdman> k :(
04:24 < dongs> even the standard itself isn't free how you expect freetards to give away 
               testing/checking thing for it
04:24  * upgrdman hugs mother russia
04:24 < upgrdman> http://caxapa.ru/thumbs/468328/misra-c-2004.pdf
04:24 < dongs> yeah .ru sounds like an official site for it
04:24 < englishman> cant be that good if its waht toyota uses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On food.cn
09:37 < crt> they'll make you eat eggs with chicken foetuses inside them
09:38 < dongs> isnt that what an egg is


On corporate america
02:36 < dongs> some dude from 1 infinity loop ordered jewpad adapters
02:36 < dongs> am i gonna get [ ] DMCA [ ] cloned
02:36 < englishman> both

on norwegians:
22:58 < Laurenceb_> talking of pol I saw Breviks manifesto
22:58 < Laurenceb_> he uses <<>> instead of ""
22:58 < Laurenceb_> zyp confirmed as Brevik

on code style:
00:38 < anton02> the problem with correct indentation of code is that you have to interrupt your 
                 train of thought about what you're actually doing in code.

on crossfit, no, vaping,
18:10 < emeryth> just make the display show a blinking "I VAPE"


On food.... and things every pcb needs...
20:10 < upgrdman_> so im placing an order on amazon for these stroopwafels
  that you fucks love. i need $10 more of shit to get past the Add On Item limit
20:10 < upgrdman_> wtf should i buy
20:11 < BrainDamage> upgrdman: sma connectors
... later ...
22:34 < upgrdman> damn. ate the entire box of poopwafels. no self control :/

07:15 < upgrdman> and wtf is it with them serving the head of the cooked animal with the rest of it. 
07:15 < upgrdman> like a chicken, with the fucking burnt ass head staring me in the eye
07:15 < upgrdman> and pig like that too
07:16 < upgrdman> and pigeon
07:16 < PaulFertser> Get what you deserve filthy corpse eaters.

On clients... or... something.
00:34 < upgrdman> sup with you?
00:35 < stm32> just doin a few repairs
00:35 < upgrdman> dj's jizzed on their mixers again?
00:35 < stm32> nah beer mate
00:35 < upgrdman> nice
00:35 < stm32> if it was jiss i'd already have licked it up

On kickstarter
18:42 < emeb> lol - client's kickstarter passed $200k
18:42 < emeb> Now he's wondering how he'll fulfill it.
18:42 < emeb> (not really, but it does change the scope of the task a lot)

On holidays....
18:27 < jpa-> our vacation tastes are fortunately very cheap :P
18:37 < englishman> take the family into the sauna just out back
18:37 < englishman> vacation done
18:39 < BrainDamage> don't take them out the sauna and crank up the heat
18:39 < BrainDamage> save on future expenses

On operating systems, windows, mac, linux.... maybe...
13:58 < dongs> stop wasting time with win10
13:58 < dongs> its not gonna work

on... philosphy?
15:53 < vampi-the-frog> after all, STM32's are the superior microcontrollers uber alles
15:54 < aandrew> absolutely
15:54 < vampi-the-frog> and we should invade neighboring countries, I mean manufacturers
15:54 < vampi-the-frog> the STM32 reich will last a thousand years
15:54 < aandrew> we shall wage jihad against the NXPs and the weak Nuvotons of the world
15:55 < aandrew> some will say "but sirs! are we all not of the same ISA? if you reset us, do we 
                 not pull SP and PC from the vector table?"
15:57 < aandrew> and I shall say "while this may be so, we are shaped by the licensee and through 
                 this shaping we are separate. Through the poor documentation of your vendors we 
                 draw our strength, and through solid distribution channels we prevail over you"


lolrence
23:55 < Laurenceb_> I went on omegle earlier
23:55 < Laurenceb_> some black guy was jerking 2 me
23:55 < Laurenceb_> then some nasty slut riding a dildo came on
23:56 < Laurenceb_> and started swearing at me and telling me to clean my room



audiophools more
01:46 < Ultrasauce> mine is all still sitting on breadboards and detunes if you hit the table
01:47 < emeb> analog expo converters?
01:47 < Ultrasauce> ya
01:47 < emeb> those are a PITA
01:48 < emeb> all my oscillator designs are DSP with crystal reference. avoids a lot of hassle.
01:48 < Ultrasauce> pffh digital. bet your soundstage is super narrow
01:48 < emeb> lol.
01:48 < emeb> audiophools can jump in a lake.


On experience (and the joys of early stm32s)
18:20 <con3> wish I started 8.5 years ago
18:21 <Steffanx> wut, you were like 11 when you did that?
18:21 <jpa-> so that you would have had chance to experience texane/stlink, stdperiphlib and F1 GPIO config?
18:21 <Steffanx> stm32f100 \o/
18:21 <Steffanx> Whopping 24mhz
18:21 <con3> well just would have had more experience, shit feels like an up hill battle rn
18:22 <jpa-> trust me, it would have been more so back then :P

On PWM rates required
11:24:23         qyx | you can switch your signals at 20GHz
11:24:48         qyx | to avoid LED flickering while PWMing
11:26:39      doomba | was using 12Ghz but the flicker was still noticable.
11:26:45           * | doomba snorts another line
11:27:25         qyx | jadew` is pro on multi-GHz flicker-less LED driving
11:27:30         qyx | he knows FETs
11:36:46  Ultrasauce | the eye can only see 30 GHz
11:41:22   Mangy_Dog | wait what
11:41:32   Mangy_Dog | youre seeing led flicker in the ghz range!?
11:41:49   Mangy_Dog | is this a joke?
11:41:58  Ultrasauce | absolutely serious
11:42:22   Mangy_Dog | i dont think you are!?
11:42:46  Ultrasauce | think harder
11:42:55   Mangy_Dog | you certainly shouldnt be seeing flicker at 1ghz even with a moving led....
11:44:01  Ultrasauce | you can avoid the flicker if you synchronize it to your brain's clock signal


On Alarm clocks:
22:16:36     kakimir | I made alarm clock out of beer
22:16:46     kakimir | I drank the beer
22:17:21     kakimir | so around 7AM I have full bladder
22:17:49     kakimir | it sends signals to my brain and makes me uncomfortable
22:17:57     kakimir | so that I cannot sleep any longer
