Mantis? Everybody wants one, no-one has one.

But what are they for? well... things change after you have one...

03:00 < jadew> I was able to do some amazing rework with it
03:00 < jadew> no to mention some mechanical stuff that I wouldn't have dreamt of doing
03:03 < jadew> in the first day I got it I told my wife to come quick cuz I found some hidden inscriptions on our coins
03:03 < jadew> I was able to write in the O in ROMANI on a coin like this one:

03:03 < jadew> the message was "Blowjob?" (only 4 letters in romanian :P)
03:04 < jadew> the answer was no...


jpa has a ADSM-201 (~130 on banggood and friends)

6:51 <jpa-> karlp: not sure if it appears as USB device at all, it has hdmi out and usb for power; that video i recorded on SD card while watching on the small screen
16:51 <jpa-> Steffanx: more like babbys first bga stress
16:52 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, the gold ring rotates for focus
16:53 <jpa-> karlp: it's an ok microscope and image quality on external HDMI display is great, but it's kind of shame that the built-in display has 320x240 px resolution only - one would think there would be some higher resolution mobile phone displays available
6:53 <karlp> jpa-: the pics imply it has a usb-mini-b port ont he screen s well? is that the power one? I thought from the pics it was powered by a usb cable to the base?
16:54 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, it came with two cables, the base one only powers the leds
16:54 <jpa-> i've modded mine so that there is usb connector in the base so that i can connect the screen to that
16:55 <jpa-> (the screen/microscope part can be taken out and used with any kind of base)


Later.
01:09 <englishman> cheap binocular thing from microscopenet and a 0.5x to increase working distance, also brings it up to a comfortable height to use while seated
01:09 <zyp> the thing I don't like about magnifiers/microscopes is how they fuck with depth perception
01:10 <englishman> tbh I don't know how I worked on stuff before it. it's so comfortable, bright and easy to use
01:10 <fenugrec> englishman, so around 10x total mag ? (eyepiece 10, typical lens x2, adapter 0.5)
01:10 <englishman> let me check
01:11 <fenugrec> I used one a while ago enough to get used to it, I kinda miss the comfortable seating and bionic vision. No idea what kind of setup it was
01:11 <englishman> 1 x 0.5X Auxiliary Objective Lens for Stereo Microscope D48mm (AJ6D5AUX1) = US$48.99
01:11 <englishman> 1 x OMAX 6.7X-45X Simal-focal Stereo Microscope on Articulated Stand with 144 LED Light and 9.0MP Camera (W43DF1-L144L-C90U) = US$959.99
01:11 <englishman> the camera was junk
01:12 <fenugrec> Saw tons of OMAX on ebay, assumed they were cheap garbage but 900 ain't cheap
01:12 <englishman> so total 3.2x - 23x
01:13 <englishman> most of the time hovering around 3-10x id guess
01:14 <fenugrec> interesting. Do the fumes make a mess on the lens or do you have ventilation ?
01:14 <englishman> the camera and even the trinocular version isn't necessary. the light is necessary and the boom stand is very handy though can shake a little if there is something vibrating or your floor typically shakes when a truck goes by
01:14 <englishman> never had a problem with fumes
01:14 <englishman> never cleaned it
01:17 <aandrew> fenugrec: I have an 8yo now (wow time flies) amscope trinocular inspection scope 0.4...3.something? with the x10wf eyepieces
01:18 <aandrew> strata: yeah I'm fantastically nearsighted too, although in the last year I find I can no longer counteract my eyeglasses when looking up close, I am constantly taking the fucking things off and on
01:21 <aandrew> I recently added a barlow lens to it so it gives me more space to work
01:21 <fenugrec> aandrew, what sort of working distance before/after ?
01:22 <fenugrec> depends on zoom I guess
01:22 <aandrew> yeah camera/trinoc is not useful, but if you insist don't use a shitty usb webcam, way too much lag
01:22 <aandrew> I don't remember to be honest. "enough" in both cases, but with the barlow lens I get antoher 2-3 inches I'd say
01:22 <aandrew> I used it for 7 years without the barlow lens
01:23 <aandrew> no real issues, but yes high zoom and dense boards was getting a little cramped when I had scope probes and soldering stuff in there

Ultrasauce:
amscope SM-4TPZ
