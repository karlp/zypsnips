Mantis? Everybody wants one, no-one has one.

But what are they for? well... things change after you have one...

03:00 < jadew> I was able to do some amazing rework with it
03:00 < jadew> no to mention some mechanical stuff that I wouldn't have dreamt of doing
03:03 < jadew> in the first day I got it I told my wife to come quick cuz I found some hidden inscriptions on our coins
03:03 < jadew> I was able to write in the O in ROMANI on a coin like this one: 
http://media1.allnumis.com/314/09-02-2012/5-bani-2012_314_03842763cf37e51fL.jpg
03:03 < jadew> the message was "Blowjob?" (only 4 letters in romanian :P)
03:04 < jadew> the answer was no...


jpa has a ADSM-201 (~130 on banggood and friends)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mJ6vfdPjXE
6:51 <jpa-> karlp: not sure if it appears as USB device at all, it has hdmi out and usb for power; that video i recorded on SD card while watching on the small screen
16:51 <jpa-> Steffanx: more like babbys first bga stress
16:52 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, the gold ring rotates for focus
16:53 <jpa-> karlp: it's an ok microscope and image quality on external HDMI display is great, but it's kind of shame that the built-in display has 320x240 px resolution only - one would think there would be some higher resolution mobile phone displays available
6:53 <karlp> jpa-: the pics imply it has a usb-mini-b port ont he screen s well? is that the power one? I thought from the pics it was powered by a usb cable to the base?
16:54 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, it came with two cables, the base one only powers the leds
16:54 <jpa-> i've modded mine so that there is usb connector in the base so that i can connect the screen to that
16:55 <jpa-> (the screen/microscope part can be taken out and used with any kind of base)


Later.
01:09 <englishman> cheap binocular thing from microscopenet and a 0.5x to increase working distance, also brings it up to a comfortable height to use while seated
01:09 <zyp> the thing I don't like about magnifiers/microscopes is how they fuck with depth perception
01:10 <englishman> tbh I don't know how I worked on stuff before it. it's so comfortable, bright and easy to use
01:10 <fenugrec> englishman, so around 10x total mag ? (eyepiece 10, typical lens x2, adapter 0.5)
01:10 <englishman> let me check
01:11 <fenugrec> I used one a while ago enough to get used to it, I kinda miss the comfortable seating and bionic vision. No idea what kind of setup it was
01:11 <englishman> 1 x 0.5X Auxiliary Objective Lens for Stereo Microscope D48mm (AJ6D5AUX1) = US$48.99
01:11 <englishman> 1 x OMAX 6.7X-45X Simal-focal Stereo Microscope on Articulated Stand with 144 LED Light and 9.0MP Camera (W43DF1-L144L-C90U) = US$959.99
01:11 <englishman> the camera was junk
01:12 <fenugrec> Saw tons of OMAX on ebay, assumed they were cheap garbage but 900 ain't cheap
01:12 <englishman> so total 3.2x - 23x
01:13 <englishman> most of the time hovering around 3-10x id guess
01:14 <fenugrec> interesting. Do the fumes make a mess on the lens or do you have ventilation ?
01:14 <englishman> the camera and even the trinocular version isn't necessary. the light is necessary and the boom stand is very handy though can shake a little if there is something vibrating or your floor typically shakes when a truck goes by
01:14 <englishman> never had a problem with fumes
01:14 <englishman> never cleaned it
01:17 <aandrew> fenugrec: I have an 8yo now (wow time flies) amscope trinocular inspection scope 0.4...3.something? with the x10wf eyepieces
01:18 <aandrew> strata: yeah I'm fantastically nearsighted too, although in the last year I find I can no longer counteract my eyeglasses when looking up close, I am constantly taking the fucking things off and on
01:21 <aandrew> I recently added a barlow lens to it so it gives me more space to work
01:21 <fenugrec> aandrew, what sort of working distance before/after ?
01:22 <fenugrec> depends on zoom I guess
01:22 <aandrew> yeah camera/trinoc is not useful, but if you insist don't use a shitty usb webcam, way too much lag
01:22 <aandrew> I don't remember to be honest. "enough" in both cases, but with the barlow lens I get antoher 2-3 inches I'd say
01:22 <aandrew> I used it for 7 years without the barlow lens
01:23 <aandrew> no real issues, but yes high zoom and dense boards was getting a little cramped when I had scope probes and soldering stuff in there

Ultrasauce:
amscope SM-4TPZ
03:06 <Ultrasauce> yeah i am happy with my sm-4tpz, still need to get a camera though
03:07 <Ultrasauce> in my experience it has proven perfectly suitable for both smt rework and getting lost in the surface of roughly sawn wood while on drugs



Later again:
14:43 <zyp> okay, so what's the shit if I want a microscope?
14:49 <englishman> i really like these OMAX trinocular
14:49 <englishman> with 0.5x barlow so you have a good working distance and can sit with good posture
14:49  * antto gives zyp a "Dear Santa, ..." template letter
14:50 <englishman> without the barlow it's a 6.7x - 45x, divide that by two. that magnification range is plenty for electronics
14:50 <englishman> add a good adjustable LED ring light on that, trinocular attachment for if you want to add a camera eventually
14:51 <englishman> total with stand should be like $1k
14:51 <zyp> yeah, I figure I absolutely want a trinocular one, not spending money on something shittier
14:51 <englishman> https://omaxmicroscope.com/stereo-microscopes/zoom-trinocular/7x-45x-professional-zoom-boom-stand-trinocular-stereo-microscope.html
14:52 <englishman> add barlow, light, and change the stand if you want. i have a big boom stand, it's less stable than a stand like that but more versatile
14:52 <zyp> I've been picking at some 1.6x1.6mm qfns today, even the alignment dot is annoying to see 
14:53 <englishman> actually that $1k includes some awful $300 usb camera that i never use
14:53 <englishman> https://omaxmicroscope.com/stereo-microscopes/zoom-trinocular/7x-45x-zoom-trinocular-stereo-microscope-on-articulating-arm-post-stand.html
14:53 <englishman> i have a boom like that one
14:53 <zyp> yeah, that looks nice
14:54 <englishman> i made a little adapter to attach my sony SLR and use that if i want a camera attached
14:54 <zyp> I was also thinking about that
14:54 <englishman> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXlJemfR4rA
14:54 <englishman> example video
14:55 <qyx> 16:52 < zyp> I've been picking at some 1.6x1.6mm qfns today, even the alignment dot is annoying to see 
14:55 <qyx> TPS62825 spotted
14:55 <englishman> another https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEaKtezfFVI
14:56 <zyp> qyx, no, SLG46811V
14:57 <zyp> and also SLG46582V, but that's 2x3mm
14:59 <Steffanx> Got this one ages back.. its fine https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32880372287.html but it was cheaper back then
14:59 <Steffanx> and i want that arm englishman has now :P
15:00 <Steffanx> yeah, aliexpress has something, but > $100 shipping. meh
15:14 <zyp> englishman, so you've got a kit like this? https://omaxmicroscope.com/7x-45x-9-0mp-digital-zoom-trinocular-stereo-microscope-on-articulating-arm-stand-with-144-led-light-1708.html
15:16 <englishman> yep looks exactly the same except for maybe the camera
15:16 <englishman> and the 0.5x addon
15:20 <qyx> I can see a java app
16:36 <aandrew> zyp: oh you got a much nicer arm than me, but my microscope head is identical
16:37 <zyp> not me, I was just looking at what I should consider getting
16:38 <aandrew> I added a 0.7x barlow lens and I have a much better camera than that, but very rarely use it
16:38 <aandrew> I've got a little basler HD industrial video camera on the trinocular port
16:52 <aandrew> I find USB (2.0) cameras have too much lag for me. Haven't tried a USB 3 one though
17:00 <jpa-> https://eleshop.eu/szm7045nt-stl2.html   i've considered these, but too expensive for me :)
17:02 <jpa-> cheaper than that omax stuff though
17:07 <aandrew> jpa-: that's exactly what my amscope looks like. EUR$500 is approximately what I paid too (USD$700) over a decade ago
17:07 <englishman> looks identical
17:08 <aandrew> the barlow lens is well worth it, the 40x zoom with the 10x eyepiece lens was just stupidly close to be of any real use, with the 0.7x barlow I use a lot more of the zoom range
17:09 <aandrew> I can slice and swap two 5mil traces 5mil apart without it on full zoom which is about as fine detail as I need
