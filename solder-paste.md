## Paste

```
17:12 < englishman> man this paste is a game changerTM
17:13 < englishman> i no longer feel like im wasting my fucking time
17:16 < ReadError> what paste?
17:17 < englishman> gc 10
17:17 < ReadError> I've still not used anything that compares to zeph but $$$$
17:17 < englishman> this shit smells great
17:17 < englishman> like metal wildflowers
17:17 < ReadError> zeph smells like some kinda baked good to me
17:18 < englishman> i cant afford zeph
17:18 < englishman> like after their racism fees and shit its like $200 an ounce
17:18 < englishman> gc 10 you leave at roomtemp too
17:18 < englishman> so its ready to go at 6am like an all hours call girl

## Solder
```
16:38 <BrainDamage> btw, zypsnips could get an entry on solder alloys, got me Sn 99 Ag 0.3 Cu 0.7 and it flows nicely at 350
16:38 <englishman> as a paste?
16:38 <BrainDamage> no, wire
16:38 <BrainDamage> for rework
16:38 <englishman> ah
16:38 <englishman> surely that depends on the flux?
16:39 <englishman> i have sn99 that i abhor
16:39 <BrainDamage> yes, also depends on the flux
16:39 <BrainDamage> that's one of the reasons why I suggested pooling results on zypsnips
16:40 <BrainDamage> simple rosin flux here
16:40 <englishman> is it that much cheaper than sac305
16:41 <BrainDamage> yes, at the expense of much higher melting point

11:48 <jpa-> karlp: so, what is your favourite lead-free alloy for hand soldering?
11:52 <qyx> I am using this now https://www.broquetas.com/en-product-eco-4-lead-free-solid-wire-for-electronic-soldering.php
11:52 <mouseghost> wo there are different?
11:52 <qyx> (sorry for being karlp)
11:53 <BrainDamage> Sn Cu Ag works for me too
11:53 <BrainDamage> the more the Ag, the better it seeems to work
11:53 <jpa-> yeah, Sn96.5Cu0.5Ag3  is what i have also, works but i do notice the melting point being rather high
11:54 <qyx> it is hard to find anything with lower melting point
11:53 <BrainDamage> Sn Cu Ag works for me too
11:53 <BrainDamage> the more the Ag, the better it seeems to work
11:53 <jpa-> yeah, Sn96.5Cu0.5Ag3  is what i have also, works but i do notice the melting point being rather high
11:54 <qyx> it is hard to find anything with lower melting point
11:54 <qyx> 217 째C is pretty low
11:55 <jpa-> 217째C is quite high compared to the 179째C leaded solder i like :)
11:58 <qyx> I am cheating and using leaded solder for big QFNs
12:00 <jpa-> i'm considering trying out SN42/BI58
12:00 <jpa-> it's rather expensive though
2:21 <karlp> we're using 97sc == sac305 == same as yours jpa 
12:21 <karlp> 3 silver 0.5  cu.
12:22 <karlp> I don't solder a lot, I don't have strong opinions on it.
12:22 <karlp> it's lead free, that's enough?
12:23 <jpa-> possibly i'll just need a better soldering iron at some point
12:23 <jpa-> ts-100 is having trouble with it
12:24 <BrainDamage> zyp: you mean few features stl laks
12:25 <BrainDamage> jpa-: what temp are you using?
12:25 <jpa-> 370-400째C usually
12:26 <BrainDamage> mmm, 325-350 works sufficiently with my ts100, what kind of tip?
12:26 <jpa-> TS-C1
12:27 <jpa-> with TS-BC2 it's better, but too big for many things
13:50 <englishman> im down with that multicore sac305 just because the flux is so good
