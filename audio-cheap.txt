Summary, PAM8301 "worked pretty good!"  (good enough that emeb went and bought some)
Make sure to go to the bottom for the updates

13:48 < dongs> emeb: found PAM8301 for $~0.20
13:49 < dongs> whats your higher highs assessment of that one
13:49 < emeb> looking...
13:50 < emeb> that's cute
13:50 < emeb> tiny, no big caps needed...
13:58 < emeb> dongs: looks like a nice part. You can make a simple RC LPF for
reconstruction and gain 
              control but it's hard for me to tell right off what the ideal
values would be.
13:59 < emeb> so that plus 3 passive parts hooked to the F4xx DAC output would
probably work fine.
13:59 < dongs> emeb: on where? input or output
14:01 < emeb> F4xx DAC pin - DC blocking cap (0.1-1.0uf) - LPF & Gain resistor
- PAM input
14:01 < emeb> then an LPF cap from PAM input to GND
14:01 < dongs> hm thats adding more parts than i really care about
14:01 < dongs> i can understand rc lpf, what about rest of shit?
14:01 < dongs> wahts gain for
14:02 < emeb> DC blocking cap?
14:02 < dongs> no like
14:02 < dongs> i ahve dc cap now
14:02 < dongs> dac -> cap -> pam input
14:02 < dongs> i can add a rc lpf after cap (?or before cap?)
14:02 < dongs> but whats the 'gain resistor' thing?
14:03 < emeb> gain resistor is to control how hard the DAC drives the amp
14:03 < emeb> if DAC full swing overdrives the amp then you lose resolution
14:03 < emeb> so resistor is there to limit gain
14:04 < emeb> DAC gives ~3.3Vpp
14:04 < dongs> but if you turn on buffer
14:04 < dongs> its less
14:04 < emeb> only slightly less
14:04 < emeb> 3.1Vpp maybe
14:05 < dongs> so you think its necesary
14:05 < emeb> you could always just reduce the signal range in DSP
14:05 < emeb> but that cuts resolution and raises noise floor
14:05 < emeb> so it's better to use analog gain -> resistor
14:06 < emeb> But - for minimum parts, just use DC blocking cap and make up for
it in software.
14:06 < dongs> yay
14:07 < emeb> If it were me I'd put two more passives in the signal path just
for pro / hifi. :)
14:08 < dongs> so R in series and C to gnd right? but thats just LPF?
14:08 < emeb> yes
14:08 < dongs> or do you mean another R after that for gain?
14:08 < emeb> no
14:08 < dongs> just thast?
14:08 < emeb> yes
14:08 < emeb> the PAM input has 10k impedance
14:08 < emeb> so the value of R you use affects gain too
14:08 < dongs> ah right
14:08 < dongs> im looking at some tarduino shit
14:08 < dongs> 1.5k/10nF for 11khz lpf
14:09 < Laurenceb> lol
14:09 < Laurenceb> dongs is a perman00b
14:09 < dongs> yuep
14:09 < dongs> and proud of it
14:09 < dongs> i leave analol'g shit to pros
14:10 < dongs> emeb: wait, that RC is before or after ac bias cap
14:10 < emeb> dongs: yes - those values give ~10.6kHz corner freq
14:10 < Laurenceb> Quinetiq etc
14:10 < emeb> and it doesn't matter what order you put them in
14:11 < dongs> mmkay ill do them before
14:11 < emeb> but I'd put DC cap @ F4 output, then R, then C
14:11 < dongs> o okay
14:11 < dongs> then after.
14:11 < emeb> the 1.5k resistor won't affect gain much
14:11 < dongs> i could always replace it wiht 0R
14:11 < dongs> and NP the cap
14:12 < dongs> for max pro
14:12 < emeb> yes
14:12 < dongs> if something isnt working
14:13 < emeb> if you need to cut gain then just multiply R and divide C by same
factor to preserve corner freq
14:13 < emeb> (so double R, half C, etc)

--- "later" ---

00:29 < emeb> dongs: PAM8301 working - such loud, very gain, wow.
00:29 < dongs> lol
00:29 < dongs> indeed
00:30 < dongs> i had to like 1/4 the dac outputs
00:30 < dongs> and it was still almost clipping
00:30 < emeb> I put a 100k resistor in the path to the amp input
00:30 < emeb> still very loud

--- "later still" ---
22:00 <emeb> karlp: heh - that PAM8301 mentioned in the zypsnips is kinda weaksauce. I've tried to use it to drive cheap 8ohm speakers and it distorts badly at any usable volume.




----- separately ----
18:47 <BrainDamage> yes, you need a 12ax7 tube driven by 120V
18:47 <kakimir> how many watts?
18:47 <BrainDamage> encased in a 10kg block, for vibration dampening
18:48 <BrainDamage> 3-6 for the filament, depending on the drive
18:48 <BrainDamage> output will be few douzens mW, a hundred at best
18:50 <kakimir> not enough
18:51 <Steffanx> Just ask what crt would do. He's into amplification
18:54 <BrainDamage> if you want super pro solution that no audiophile would ever approve, get an ADSL line driver
18:54 <BrainDamage> their current capability, slew rate and distortion figures beat all headphone shit hands down
18:54 <BrainDamage> and they cost 2$
