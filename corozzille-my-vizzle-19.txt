09:38:34 t4nk_freenode | but I have hardly seen any discussion about chips
09:38:38          jpa- | t4nk_freenode: uh, you do realize that this is #corona32, the #stm32 name is just a holdover
09:38:45 t4nk_freenode | lol
09:38:51          jpa- | corona discussions 32 hours a day
09:39:00 t4nk_freenode | youknow.. someone warned me for that befor I came here
09:39:32          jpa- | t4nk_freenode: so that's what they warn about now? usually the ##stm32 disclaimer was that
