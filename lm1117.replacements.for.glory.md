## The venerable LM1117 and friends burn 5mA Quiescent current.
yes... see it _everywhere_ in SOT223 and SOT89, as the "drop a basic LDO down" for like "a bit" of power.
Comes in "second sources" from _thousands_ of vendors, available for cents.  Good for it.
It also has a high dropout voltage, around 1V or more, and it absolutely just _burns_ power,
with a "typical" 5mA in quiescent current!

It's 2022. You can do better.  (And you have been able to for years)

The parts below are all around under 100uA in quiescent current.

## Pin Compatible options in SOT223
Expect to pay around 5-7c for these, instead of ~3-5c.  Yes, if you hate everyone, keep just living in the 70s.
Otherwise, buy these better options, and we'll get more people making them too.

* Nanjing Micro One Elec [ME6118A family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_MICRONE-Nanjing-Micro-One-Elec-ME6118A50B3G_C151064.html) (Iq: 53uA, VinMax: 18V, Vdrop: varies with load)
 (This one comes in different pin configurations, the 'A' suffix is the "normal" one you want)
* Seaward Elec [SE5120 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Seaward-Elec-SE5120ST33-HF_C402714.html) and [SED5120](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Seaward-Elec-SED5120_C2838439.html) (Iq: 150uA, VinMax: 6V, Vdrop: 300mV) (Note, this also comes in different pinconfigs, you want the "T" suffix, _not_ the "G" suffix)
* Lowpower [LP1116 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_LOWPOWER-LP1116-33G3F_C517179.html) (Iq: 90uA, VinMax: 6.5V, Vdrop: 480mV)
* Shanghai Mingda [MD7218 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Shanghai-Mingda-Microelectronics-MD7218C50YA2_C920492.html) (Iq: 1.6uA, VinMax: 15V, Vdrop: 650mV)

(there's others, this is what was in stock on LCSC at the time of writing.  The general trick is to look
 for _any_ LDO in SOT223, that does _not_ have "1117" in the name)

## Pin Compatible options in SOT89
Probably the same parts, but I've not gone explicitly looking, SOT223 is the most common "I'm not going to think,
I'm just going to drop an LM1117 on it" part. 

## But wait, there's more!
What?! More!?  Yes.  In ~all of these cases, you'll also get better/lower dropout voltage.

## But wait, there's less?
Some of these parts may have lower VinMax.  that may or not even matter.

## High Iq? Just say NO!
(5mA-100uA) @ 3.3V means ~16mW per device savings.
@ 100K parts, @ 24/7, (wildly low parts, probably wildly high runtime) that's already
@ 100k parts @ 24/7 (yes, not all assumptions are reasonable) => that's already 14 MWh per year in "free" energy.
Is that a lot? well, depends. Using [EIA estimates](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3) that's between 1 and 2 US homes, for a year.  So, not a lot.... no, but, it's _free_ You literally just have to stop using 70s tech solutions!
