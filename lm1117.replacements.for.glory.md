## The venerable LM1117 and friends burn 5mA Quiescent current.
yes... see it _everywhere_ in SOT223 and SOT89, as the "drop a basic LDO down" for like "a bit" of power.
Comes in "second sources" from _thousands_ of vendors, available for cents.  Good for it.
It also has a high dropout voltage, around 1V or more, and it absolutely just _burns_ power,
with a "typical" 5mA in quiescent current!

It's 2022. You can do better.  (And you have been able to for years)

The parts below are all around or under 100uA in quiescent current, _and_ pin compatible! Just drop and go!

## Pin Compatible options in SOT223

### China options
Expect to pay around 5-10c for these, instead of  ~3-5C for x1117 parts.
* Nanjing Micro One Elec [ME6118A family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_MICRONE-Nanjing-Micro-One-Elec-ME6118A50B3G_C151064.html) (Iq: 53uA, VinMax: 18V, Vdrop: varies with load)
 (This one comes in different pin configurations, the 'A' suffix is the "normal" one you want)
* Seaward Elec [SE5120 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Seaward-Elec-SE5120ST33-HF_C402714.html) and [SED5120](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Seaward-Elec-SED5120_C2838439.html) (Iq: 150uA, VinMax: 6V, Vdrop: 300mV) (Note, this also comes in different pinconfigs, you want the "T" suffix, _not_ the "G" suffix)
* Lowpower [LP1116 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_LOWPOWER-LP1116-33G3F_C517179.html) (Iq: 90uA, VinMax: 6.5V, Vdrop: 480mV)
* Shanghai Mingda [MD7218 family](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Linear-Voltage-Regulators-LDO_Shanghai-Mingda-Microelectronics-MD7218C50YA2_C920492.html) (Iq: 1.6uA, VinMax: 15V, Vdrop: 650mV)

(there's others, this is what was in stock on LCSC at the time of writing.  The general trick is to look
 for _any_ LDO in SOT223, that does _not_ have "1117" in the name)

### "expensive" options
On Mouser, at the time of writing, a "good" option, the AP2111 and AP2114 are both _cheaper_ than the
cheapest legacy x1117 part, the SPX1117, at €0.16 vs €0.18 in hundreds)

* Diodes [AP2111H family](https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/115/DiodesInc_10212021_AP2111-2636031.pdf)
 or [AP2114 family](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP2114.pdf)
 (Iq: 55uA, Vdrop: 1000mV, VinMax: 6.5V) (Comes in multiple pinouts!)
* Diodes [AP7365 family](https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/115/DIOD_S_A0001069339_1-2512690.pdf) (Iq: 35uA, VinMax: 6V, Vdrop: 370mV) (Comes in multiple pinouts!)
* Diodes [AP7361](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP7361C.pdf) (Iq: 60uA, Vdrop: 360mV, VinMax: 6V)

Yay Diodes? No-one else? really? Booooo!

### "1117" updates...
* Onsemi's [NCP1117LP](https://www.onsemi.com/products/power-management/linear-regulators-ldo/ncp1117lp)  (Iq: 500uA, Vdrop: 1.3V, VinMax: 18) (See below)
* ST's [LDL1117](https://www.st.com/en/power-management/ldl1117.html) (Iq: 250uA, VinMax: 18V) (See below)
* TI's [TLV1117LV](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlv1117lv.pdf) (Iq: 100uA, VinMax: 6V, Vdrop: ~500mV)
* Microchip's [TC2117](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology/TC2117-25VDBTR) (Iq: 80uA, VinMax: 6V, Vdrop: varies)

A few western vendors have realised the issue, and made "updated" x1117 designs.  Onsemi, TI, ST... They're ok,
they're certainly _better_ than the legacy x1117 designs, but you can normally still do better. You normally get to
keep the 15-18V VinMax limit with these parts though.  I've tried to list them above.
Kudos to them for at least recognising that this is something that not just _can_, but _should_ be improved.


## Pin Compatible options in SOT89
Probably the same parts, but I've not gone explicitly looking, SOT223 is the most common "I'm not going to think,
I'm just going to drop an LM1117 on it" part. 

## But wait, there's more!
What?! More!?  Yes.  In ~all of these cases, you'll also get better/lower dropout voltage.

## But wait, there's less?
Some of these parts may have lower VinMax.  that may or not even matter.
You will pay _fractionally_ more for these parts compared to xxx1117 clones, 
Yes, if you hate everyone, keep just living in the 70s.
Otherwise, buy these better options, and we'll get more people making them too.

## High Iq? Just say NO!
(5mA-100uA) @ 3.3V means ~16mW per device savings.
@ 100K parts, @ 24/7, (wildly low parts, probably wildly high runtime) that's already
@ 100k parts @ 24/7 (yes, not all assumptions are reasonable) => that's already 14 MWh per year in "free" energy.
Is that a lot? well, depends. Using [EIA estimates](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3) that's between 1 and 2 US homes, for a year.  So, not a lot.... no, but, it's _free_ You literally just have to stop using 70s tech solutions!

Yes. I _am_ asking you to pay a tiny bit more to save power that probably won't ever pay off on _your_ BOM.
If western parts are already ~equivalent on price and china parts are single digit cents, for a 
_regulator_ that is low single digits for BOM line items, then yes, you _can_ and _should_ pay this price.
You should be paying for parts that don't suck, even if the "suck" aspect is not one that matters to your particular end product.  Vote with your $, select parts that are _good_.
