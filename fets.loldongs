 dongs> who ever recommended IRLML6401 they're amaze
karl> DMP3099 is cheaper, slightly lower RdsOn
karl> AO3401 too
ultra likes dmg2301
AO3422 for higher voltage than ao3400/3401...
si2356 similar


11:58 < dongs> PeterM: waht are  your generic grabbag nfets
11:59 < dongs> cheap/common shit
11:59 < dongs> been using nds355an, looking to diversify
12:13 < dongs> http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/images/evaluation_tools/Eval-ADD5211.jpg
12:14 < PeterM> i dont use anything in that range usually, sorry. i usually use BSS138 to buffer IO and Si2304 for anything power
12:14 < dongs> mghg si 2304 looks ~comparable tonds
12:14 < PeterM> erp not Si2304 SIA418
12:15 < PeterM> wrong lib copy+paste
12:15 < dongs> lol chinamosfet
12:15 < PeterM> chinamosfet? 
                http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Vishay%20Siliconix%20PDFs/SIA418DJ.pdf
12:15 < dongs> o
12:15 < dongs> yeah thats an oddball apckage
12:15 < dongs> nice rdson
12:16 < dongs> wait
12:16 < dongs> its like a hardcore version of sot23-6
12:16 < dongs> or is that one size down
12:16 < dongs> i always confuse wtf sc70 is
12:17 < dongs> ended up with a bunch of tiny fucking smaller-than-sot23-6 shits a while ago when 
               I meant to order the big sized
12:19 < dongs> PeterM: looks good, saved
12:19 < PeterM> it is same board size as sot-23 but made hueg current

SOT23 fets, updated...
10:32 < jpa-> bsh105
10:34 < qyx> bss123
10:35 < qyx> jpa-'s is better
10:36 < PeterM> qyxs one is cheaper
10:37 < PeterM> and if you're buying from china, ao3400 is both cheaper and better
(2020: ao3400/ao3401 is NRND, and replacement is not as good at 3.3v, si3400/3401 are ~equivalent and cheap)


SO-8 fets, with a magical one footprint to rule them all.

07:07 < dongs> PeterM: but its standard dpak so i can replace it wiht wahtever
07:08 < PeterM> true but most of the good fets are in that SO-8-ish size
07:09 < dongs> isnt that garbage for dissipation
07:09 < dongs> or do you mean that PQFN type thing
07:09 < dongs> anywyho its a proto and not my problem
07:09 < dongs> and not like im suffering for space
07:10 < qyx_> so-8 fets?
07:11 < dongs> ya
07:11 < dongs> lots of those
07:11 < PeterM> https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/leaflet/75016838.pdf qyx_ page 9
[if the link is dead, the doc is called "LFPAK The toughest power-so8"]

What's that, your SO-8 with pad is getting hot? Try these other magical footprints!
< PeterM> karlp http://i.imgur.com/rkBJxOX.png add this shit to the wiki

03:00 < dongs> kakimir: yeah. i havent bothered with general purpose tho. i
have MMBT3904/3906 for pnp/npn transistors, and then NDS355AN for nfet (not really
great either), or that IRLM for p
03:00 < PeterM> i dont mind the ao3400/3407 for n and pfet, china has them super cheap
03:01 < dongs> nice rdson too

20:20:15         qyx | psmn1R2 not an option?
20:21:51         qyx | bitmask: or just select something from the psmn series, they are super-low-Rdson
20:22:07         qyx | they are going from 0.7mohm up
20:22:14         qyx | and not very expensive
20:22:15     bitmask | I see, look good, so just need one of em then?
20:22:23     bitmask | wow they are cheap
20:22:24         qyx | depends on your pcb
20:22:29     specing | huh, 0.7 mohm?
20:22:30     bitmask | i'll throw two on
20:23:06         qyx | I am using them as load switches, battery disconnects, e-fuses, etc.
20:23:22         qyx | ie. for slow switching applications
20:23:24     bitmask | yea im using them as battery disconnects
20:23:37     bitmask | thanks for the tip, these are nice
