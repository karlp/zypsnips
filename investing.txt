08:33 <jadew> I just lost all my money in my trading account
08:34 <jadew> made two mistakes: took a trade in the wrong direction (I was meaning to take it in the other direction) and the position was 20 times higher than I wanted it to be
08:34 <jadew> half an hour later, 5k got wiped out
08:35 <jadew> and with this, I'm done with trading
08:35 <ventYl> how long did you trade?
08:36 <jadew> ~one year
08:36 <ventYl> with no prior experience?
08:36 <jadew> was actually having some good success lately
08:36 <jadew> yeah
08:36 <jadew> I was up 2k for the past month
08:36 <jadew> managed to make consistent gains
08:36 <ventYl> and you went straight to short trading?
08:37 <jadew> I didn't mean to take a short position...
08:37 <jadew> but by the time I realized it was already too late
08:37 <jadew> if I didn't make that mistake, I would have been 5k up
08:37 <jadew> if I didn't make both mistakes, I would have been only ~200 up, which is what my intention was
08:38 <ventYl> i've been investigating this like ~1 year ago
08:38 <ventYl> realized that this is activity too boring for me
08:39 <jadew> man... I can't believe I lost my account to a fucking mistake
08:39 <jadew> I thought it would be due to bad judgment or something
08:39 <jadew> but in this case I just didn't pay attention to what I was doing
